  <div class="content">
    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>It’s been six months since I’ve been to India. Many things have
changed since then. I’d like to put my perspective on the last few
months.</p>
<p>First of all: you were right about space. In order to create a group
identity, territory is fundamental. Two examples make me believe this
is absolutely true.</p>
<p>The first example are Tati Wells and Ricardo Ruiz, in Rio. They
created an open space called IP. I would use other names, but they call
it a media center. I’ve been there last week, and it’s really great.
People come over for a workshop and all of a sudden they come back on
the next day. Things are being created there, people are gathering and
doing things together.</p>
<p>The other example is MetaReciclagem in Santo André. Even though the
major of Santo André has been re-elected, he changed all his closer
team. As a consequence, the EPAC project, that hosted MetaReciclagem
inside Parque Escola, has changed from the education management to the
public affairs area. Then we have been forgotten. There’s no more room
for MetaReciclagem on public projects in Santo André. We lost our lab,
computer donations (okay, we did save some) and access to the
infrastructure. Because of that, MetaReciclagem actions in Santo André
disappeared.</p>
<p>I mean, right after we were getting through about the end of our
relationship with Agente Cidadão, we lost the lab in Santo André as
well. Fortunately, the new city administration in São Paulo still did
not understand what we are doing down on Olido lab, but we can’t afford
to do much there, as everyone who used to work on Agente Cidadão and
Parque Escola had to start improvising to make a living. In a given
moment, I guess two months ago, Interney, the guy who donated us the
hosting for MetaReciclagem website and mailing list, had to put his
server down and we don’t have a stable mailing list since then. I’m
running the webserver in my home. MetaReciclagem is quiet.</p>
<p>So, it’s true. MetaReciclagem, as a group, failed to succeed without
a space of its own. Everyone is running out of money. The ship is
broken.</p>
<p>But, as I tried to explain, and I’m not quite sure I succeeded, we
don’t want to be a group. We don’t want to become a NGO. We are talking
about a methodology. And as such, I really think we were able to do
some things:</p>
<p>1) Two years ago, if one talked about a “digital inclusion” project
using old computers and FLOSS, no one would buy it. Actually, we did
talk about it, and the bigshots on the subject didn’t take us
seriously. Nowadays the biggest state bank in Brasil is actually
delivering their used computers (maaaaaany computers) to social
projects. The landless movement got a donation of over 4000 computers.
I’m not saying that they are doing this because of us, but I can assure
you that they are paying attention to us, and we were the first ones to
prove that free software and old computers were a viable solution.</p>
<p>2) The cultural spots project from the Ministry of Culture has
adopted metareciclagem (technology appropriation) as one of its four
axis, together with estudiolivre (FLOSS for media production),
radiolivre (free radios) and tactical media. They are extending the
concept of MetaReciclagem. Me, Dalton, Glauco and Fernando are getting
hired as consultants for the project (after two years of promises).</p>
<p>3) The independent metareciclagem spores are growing. There is one
on the historical coast of Bahia, that might become a cultural spot.
There is one in Salvador, in association with Rui Barbosa University.
IP, the media center created by tati and ruiz in Rio, is a
metareciclagem spore. There is even one close to Olido, our lab
downtonw São Paulo. And there are at least 20 soon-to-be cultural spots
that want to become independent metareciclagem labs.</p>
<p>4) We are planning the creation of other metareciclagem labs in the
same format as that in Santo André. Of course, we have learned that we
have to treat them as temporary labs. But I don’t see that as a
problem. </p>
<p>I can’t say MetaReciclagem failed. We’ve been through some deep
transformations, deep enough to get us scared about our personal
budgets. But MetaReciclagem is independent from us, and is completely
successful as: a) a methodology, b) a influence nucleus. We still can’t
think of MetaReciclagem as a group, but I’m sure we are helping a lot
of people to make better decisions about technology and the use of
technology.
