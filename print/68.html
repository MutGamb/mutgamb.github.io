    <i>(mensagem enviada pra lista waag-sarai)</i><br /><br />Happened again. As I was flying back to São Paulo, and having read a few things about all the political riot that is happening in Brasil right now, I realized once again that if we are willing to develop real alternatives, we can't depend on governamental efforts. An autonomous space is needed. I'm still not sure whether developing a new space is better than occupying an existing one.<br />
<br />
More than once, we have planned labs that never got real. We still have those plans. As I think I said before, creating a project in Brazil counting with financial aid from abroad never looked to us as a viable solution. Not that we have a problem with the idea, it's just that we never heard about that actually happening. All our projects were about counting on governamental support, or trying to create self-sustainability.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to think it's worth trying, perhaps mixing international funds and local sustainability. I would know how to start and put the place up, we have enough people engajed on some project or volunteers to help on that. I would really not know how to begin with the international contacts. If you guys helped us, it would be great.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying, once again, is that you were probably right, but we have had to take our time to find that out.<br />
<br />
Moreover, I truly believe midiatatica and metareciclagem could join efforts to such an effort. The skills of the two networks are complementar. If that's the case, I really think we should call such space on a different name. Perhaps come back with the idea of CafeCoLab, I don't know.<br />
<br />
Let's get working?  </div>
