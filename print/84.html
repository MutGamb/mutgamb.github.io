    <h1>What is MetaReciclagem</h1>
<p>MetaReciclagem is mostly an idea. An idea about the appropriation<br />
of technology for social transformation. The concept encompasses<br />
various forms of action: the rebirth of donated computers into recycled<br />
labs using free software and the creation of environments through the<br />
Internet where information circulates freely, as well as every type of<br />
experimentation and strategic and operational support for socially<br />
engaged projects. </p>
<h1>I got it. MetaReciclagem is a nonprofit organization?</h1>
<p>Not really. MetaReciclagem is not an NGO. At the end of 2003, when<br />
the actions of MetaReciclagem started to gather pace, we thought about<br />
creating an NGO. However the<br />
obligation to take collective decisions, giving everyone equal voting<br />
rights and the right to veto whatever their level of participation in<br />
the project, the need to give a 'proper name' to everyone and the<br />
requirements to document every little thing we wanted to do made us<br />
lose the desire to go formal. Another doubt we had was how could we use<br />
a name created collectively by tens of people that did not necessarily<br />
want to become formally involved in a organised institution without<br />
losing the support of those whose only participation in the project was<br />
to send a link a month. The long discussion on this subject was one of<br />
the main reasons Projeto Meta:Fora got emptied, and we gave up<br />
institutionalizing. </p>
<h1>So you're an "independent collective"?</h1>
<p>At the beginning, we thought we could be classified as an independent<br />
collective. But later we saw independent, anarchist, libertarian<br />
collectives, reproduce that typical 20th Century behavior: people<br />
uniting around a name and using that name to separate the "us" from<br />
"them". The result was the continuation of competitiveness and a<br />
political game in a form that is not like us. We rejected this<br />
classification also. </p>
<h1>So, you are, actually, a group that defends digital inclusion!</h1>
<p>This is contraversial. I personally, <a href="http://ogum.metareciclagem.org/weblog/index.php?p=4" class="http" rel="nofollow">disapprove the concept</a> <span class="print-footnote">[3]</span><br />
of digital inclusion. But, ok, many MetaReciclagem actions can be<br />
placed in the context of digital inclusion. However, I don´t think we<br />
can state this as our objective. Our objective is the <em>reappropriation of technology for social transformation</em>.<br />
This is so vague that it perhaps cannot be called an objective in<br />
reality. But that´s life, sometimes we don´t have names for things that<br />
do exist. </p>
<h1>But you do create telecenters, don't you?</h1>
<p>One can say so. But since many telecentre projects can be defined as<br />
joining up a load of computers, connecting them to the internet and<br />
then thinking the work is done , we prefer to talk about the creation<br />
of networks as part of what we've been calling <a href="http://metareciclagem.org/drupal/livro/conectaz" title="ConecTAZ" rel="nofollow">ConecTAZes</a> <span class="print-footnote">[4]</span>.</p>
<h1>So, what the hell are you?</h1>
<p>Actually, the problem lies in that question. It's not that we <em>are</em> MetaReciclagem. We are, instead, people that <em>do </em>MetaReciclagem<em>.</em> This group emerged in a decentralized way <em>from</em><br />
the net. It wasn't like a gathering of wise people that created a<br />
group, but people that got together because they had interests and<br />
perspectives alike. I mean, MetaReciclagem is a methodology, a name<br />
that some people use to define and identify a<br />
way of handling technology, and that aims re-appropriation of<br />
technology for social transformation. MetaReciclagem, structurally, is<br />
more of a 'bottom-up' movement, which means it is open for whoever<br />
wants to take part. For this reason MetaReciclagemdoes not have a<br />
headquarters, but <a href="http://metareciclagem.org/drupal/livro/Esporos" rel="nofollow">spores</a> <span class="print-footnote">[5]</span>:<br />
people who do MetaReciclagemin a place. Other people come to know<br />
MetaReciclagem and decide to do it in some another place. It is not<br />
necessary to pass through a long process of approval for this, its<br />
enough to talk with everyone on the mailing list and you are ready. </p>
<h1>Hmm... think I get it. But how do I become a MetaRecycler?</h1>
<p>If you are sufficiently interested to have read up to here, it is<br />
well possible that you already are a metarecycler. You only need to<br />
call the things you do <a href="http://oxossi.metareciclagem.org/moin/MetaRecycling" class="nonexistent" rel="nofollow">MetaRecycling</a> <span class="print-footnote">[6]</span> and tell us. The traditional way of doing this is to subscribe to the <a href="http://lista.metareciclagem.org/" class="http" rel="nofollow">mailing list</a> <span class="print-footnote">[7]</span>. If you want to go further and create a spore of MetaReciclagem, have a look at <a href="http://oxossi.metareciclagem.org/moin/Replicacao" rel="nofollow"> the script</a> <span class="print-footnote">[8]</span>.
