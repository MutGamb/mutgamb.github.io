Passamos na primeira pré-seleção. Textim foi esse:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1. Identify the technology application</strong><br />
Most projects dealing with the so-called “digital divide” in Brazil are
based on fallacious premises, such as: “poor people should learn how to
use a computer, in order to become more ‘employable’”; or “what we need
is money to buy brand new computers, those old ones can’t do what we
need”. MetaReciclagem started as a group concerned with the recycling
and remanufacturing of used computers, counting with a transdiciplinar
group - from Linux hackers to graphic artists and anthropologists.
Soon, we were helping social projects to use technology in order to
improve their activities, but in an inverse way: not people getting
used to the “right” use of technology, but transforming technology in
order to address those peoples’ demands. That goes from creating a
Linux distribution that runs smoothly on a 100Mhz Pentium, to the
intallation of a free Wi-Fi hotspot in a public city park, and plans to
provide Wi-Fi cards to communitary associations in poor neighbourhoods
around the park, plus many other projects.</p>
<p><strong>2. Explain how the technology application benefits humanity</strong><br />
MetaReciclagem is developing a new way to work with technology: not a
computer as an industrial product, but social technology as
craftsmanship. By attracting people with many different perspectives,
we are able to crete projects that generally cover wide areas, dealing
simultaneously with educational, economic and social issues. The result
is a methodology that treats information technology not as something
apart from people’s lives, but as a way of talking to other people, the
creation of innovative networks, and fostering the integration of local
cultures in the context of an interconnected world.</p>
<p><strong>3. State why you think the nominee deserves recognition</strong><br />
MetaReciclagem is an completely independent group, and MetaReciclagem
is a self-organizing methodology for dealing with social technology. By
dealing with real needs, and giving poor people the ability to
transform technology, we are creating new, contextualized knowledge,
everyday. MetaReciclagem didn’t import a “success story”. We learn with
external examples, sure, but we also learn with each other and with the
communities. We provide poor people not only means to access
information from all over the world, but also examples about how to use
technology to improve their own life quality.</p></blockquote>
