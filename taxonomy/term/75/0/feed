 <title>Re: Too much technology</title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;
Just sent this email to the people involved with the panel I&#039;d be joining in &lt;a href=&quot;http://ietm.org/&quot; title=&quot;IETM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IETM&lt;/a&gt; plenary session &quot;Technophobia vs Technophilia&quot;, this week in Montreal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	I think that following this kind of perspective I could be seen as leaning to technophilia, although assuming a critical position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#039;m part of a network here in Brasil - MetaReciclagem - that proposes a de-constructive approach to technology, meaning an almost intimate human-machine relationship. But that does not mean we are seduced by the so techno-fetishism that is unfortunately so common. We criticize exactly the programmed obsolescence of technologies - why shouldn&#039;t our equipment last longer if we knew how to do it, hack it, customize it? Coming from that, the more intimate we get to technology - free and open source software, freeing hardware and the such - likely more open are the possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I mean, I&#039;m talking here of a kind of sensibility and a kind of perspective in which technology should not be seen as something apart from human culture. Technology is culture, technology is human. It&#039;s a matter of understanding technology in a broader sense - a toothbrush, an axe, the ability to control fire and language, are all examples of technology, of knowledge applied in order to make life easier.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	One could spend some time talking about greek drama and the idea of machina - deus ex machina and all that stuff. In that sense, technology and the performing arts can always bring back the idea of ritualizing the use of applied knowledge. A flying belt or a sensor-arduino-pd-operated PC are all in the same level, as I see it.
