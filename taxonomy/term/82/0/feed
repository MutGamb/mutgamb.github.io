 <title>MetaReciclagem FAQ (English)</title>
 <link>http://mutgamb.org/fonte/MetaReciclagem-FAQ-English</link>
 <description>&lt;h1&gt;What is MetaReciclagem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetaReciclagem is mostly an idea. An idea about the appropriation&lt;br /&gt;
of technology for social transformation. The concept encompasses&lt;br /&gt;
various forms of action: the rebirth of donated computers into recycled&lt;br /&gt;
labs using free software and the creation of environments through the&lt;br /&gt;
Internet where information circulates freely, as well as every type of&lt;br /&gt;
experimentation and strategic and operational support for socially&lt;br /&gt;
engaged projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;I got it. MetaReciclagem is a nonprofit organization?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really. MetaReciclagem is not an NGO. At the end of 2003, when&lt;br /&gt;
the actions of MetaReciclagem started to gather pace, we thought about&lt;br /&gt;
creating an NGO. However the&lt;br /&gt;
obligation to take collective decisions, giving everyone equal voting&lt;br /&gt;
rights and the right to veto whatever their level of participation in&lt;br /&gt;
the project, the need to give a &#039;proper name&#039; to everyone and the&lt;br /&gt;
requirements to document every little thing we wanted to do made us&lt;br /&gt;
lose the desire to go formal. Another doubt we had was how could we use&lt;br /&gt;
a name created collectively by tens of people that did not necessarily&lt;br /&gt;
want to become formally involved in a organised institution without&lt;br /&gt;
losing the support of those whose only participation in the project was&lt;br /&gt;
to send a link a month. The long discussion on this subject was one of&lt;br /&gt;
the main reasons Projeto Meta:Fora got emptied, and we gave up&lt;br /&gt;
institutionalizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So you&#039;re an &quot;independent collective&quot;?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, we thought we could be classified as an independent&lt;br /&gt;
collective. But later we saw independent, anarchist, libertarian&lt;br /&gt;
collectives, reproduce that typical 20th Century behavior: people&lt;br /&gt;
uniting around a name and using that name to separate the &quot;us&quot; from&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;them&quot;. The result was the continuation of competitiveness and a&lt;br /&gt;
political game in a form that is not like us. We rejected this&lt;br /&gt;
classification also. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So, you are, actually, a group that defends digital inclusion!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is contraversial. I personally, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ogum.metareciclagem.org/weblog/index.php?p=4&quot; class=&quot;http&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;disapprove the concept&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
of digital inclusion. But, ok, many MetaReciclagem actions can be&lt;br /&gt;
placed in the context of digital inclusion. However, I don´t think we&lt;br /&gt;
can state this as our objective. Our objective is the &lt;em&gt;reappropriation of technology for social transformation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
This is so vague that it perhaps cannot be called an objective in&lt;br /&gt;
reality. But that´s life, sometimes we don´t have names for things that&lt;br /&gt;
do exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;But you do create telecenters, don&#039;t you?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can say so. But since many telecentre projects can be defined as&lt;br /&gt;
joining up a load of computers, connecting them to the internet and&lt;br /&gt;
then thinking the work is done , we prefer to talk about the creation&lt;br /&gt;
of networks as part of what we&#039;ve been calling &lt;a href=&quot;http://metareciclagem.org/drupal/livro/conectaz&quot; title=&quot;ConecTAZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ConecTAZes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So, what the hell are you?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the problem lies in that question. It&#039;s not that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; MetaReciclagem. We are, instead, people that &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;MetaReciclagem&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; This group emerged in a decentralized way &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
the net. It wasn&#039;t like a gathering of wise people that created a&lt;br /&gt;
group, but people that got together because they had interests and&lt;br /&gt;
perspectives alike. I mean, MetaReciclagem is a methodology, a name&lt;br /&gt;
that some people use to define and identify a&lt;br /&gt;
way of handling technology, and that aims re-appropriation of&lt;br /&gt;
technology for social transformation. MetaReciclagem, structurally, is&lt;br /&gt;
more of a &#039;bottom-up&#039; movement, which means it is open for whoever&lt;br /&gt;
wants to take part. For this reason MetaReciclagemdoes not have a&lt;br /&gt;
headquarters, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://metareciclagem.org/drupal/livro/Esporos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;spores&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
people who do MetaReciclagemin a place. Other people come to know&lt;br /&gt;
MetaReciclagem and decide to do it in some another place. It is not&lt;br /&gt;
necessary to pass through a long process of approval for this, its&lt;br /&gt;
enough to talk with everyone on the mailing list and you are ready. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hmm... think I get it. But how do I become a MetaRecycler?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are sufficiently interested to have read up to here, it is&lt;br /&gt;
well possible that you already are a metarecycler. You only need to&lt;br /&gt;
call the things you do &lt;a href=&quot;http://oxossi.metareciclagem.org/moin/MetaRecycling&quot; class=&quot;nonexistent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MetaRecycling&lt;/a&gt; and tell us. The traditional way of doing this is to subscribe to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lista.metareciclagem.org/&quot; class=&quot;http&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to go further and create a spore of MetaReciclagem, have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://oxossi.metareciclagem.org/moin/Replicacao&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; the script&lt;/a&gt;. That&#039;s it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
